Testing with go is not like using RSpec, mocha, jasmine, selenium ,etc..

The Go testing interface is a small set of functions, in practice it ends up with us writing normal Go code to test our code. 

2 important things:

To make a test file we just need to make a file that ends with `_test.go`
So we might make a thing called deck_test.go and then can run go test in the command line.
