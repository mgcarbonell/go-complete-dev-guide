What is a byte slice?

"Hi there" - string
gets represented as
[72 105 32 116 104 101 11 101 33] or as a byte slice in ascii

How do we write our strings to memory? we use type conversion
We take one type of value and turn it into another type
[]byte("Hi there!)
^type we want ^
              | value we have

We have    a deck
               |
           []string
               |
             string
               |
We want    []byte
